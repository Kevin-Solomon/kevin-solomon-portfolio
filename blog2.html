      <h3>3 reasons to learn JavaSCript</h3>
      <p>Almost everyone in the development community has heard about JavaScript. JavaScript is the language of the internet, it is the most commonly used programming language according to StackOverflow survey of 2021 (for the ninth year in a row). Its rise in popularity is synonymous with the rise of the internet.</p>
      <p>
        For those who do not know javascript, it is a scripting language that is one of the three languages used to build any website. Where HTML provides the structure, CSS provides styling (basically make the website look appealing), JavaScript lets you add functionality, by making it interact with the user show different results based on the input from the user. JavaScript was primarily a client-based scripting language which meant it would run in the browser, but the recent introduction of Node.Js has been a game-changer as now you can run JavaScript outside the browser on any server.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>In this post, we will look at 3 reasons Why you should  learn JavaScript in 2021</p> 
    <h4>1 - It is pre-installed in your browser</h4> 
    <p>Like I said javascript runs on your browser which means you won't have to install an interpreter or download an IDE, the barrier for entry is very low unlike other programming languages like python or java that intimidating to start with because u must complete so many steps before successfully running java code. But in Javascript, u can quite literally code in your browser which makes it easier for beginners.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>2 - JS is very versatile</h4> 
    <p>If u completely learn javascript u know that it was just a gateway for all the other technologies built on JS like ReactJS,angularJS,vueJs. you can write JS outside the browser using NodeJS and have a website that has Javascript both on the frontend and backend. U can also write Desktop applications using Javascript frameworks like react desktop (electron.js) .you can build VR applications using ReactVr as u can see the applications of javascript are endless. Having javascript in your arsenal will make u a versatile developer.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>3 - Career Opportunity</h4> 
    <p>According to indeed.com (as of 14-8-2021), there are 5566 jobs for a javascript developer. Javascript developers are in demand from startups to MNCs.This number will only increase as companies need more Javascript devs to ship their product to the internet. You can be your own boss as a freelancer. JavaScript is also amongst the highest paying jobs ranging anywhere from 6LPA to 50LPA for a fresher.
